When they think it’s the very best thing for business, they’ll know to switch it up, do it right, and really make someone doing it.”</p><p>The source justified Roman’s victory over Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 39 by saying that Reigns and Rhodes are hotter than ever as individual acts. Not to mention that Solo Sikoa and The Usos have greatly benefited from their continued association with The Tribal Chief.</p><p><a href=#>Seth Rollins: If Roman Reigns Did What I Do, We Wouldn’t Need A Secondary WWE Title</a></p><p>What do you make of this report?
