She is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">42 years</a> old as of November 2022.</p><h3>Family life</h3><p class=align-left>Ann has four siblings; an older half-sister, a younger sister, and two younger brothers. According to her, she was abused by her parents since she was seven. She claims they used to beat her with a belt and wooden spoons.</p><h3>Jodi Arias' ethnicity</h3><p class=align-left>She is of Mexican-American descent and has American nationality. Her roots are diverse and include Mexican, German, and English.</p><h3>Education profile</h3><p class=align-left>Ann attended Yreka Union High School but dropped out in the 11th grade. However, she later earned her <a href=#>GED</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/72aa60e8fc6241a4.jpg><p class=align-left>She developed an interest in photography and decided to take up photography professionally.</p><h2>Work profile</h2><p class=align-left>Although Jodi Arias' net worth is unavailable online, her work resume is known. She worked as a server in the fall of 2001 at a Californian restaurant in Ventana Inn and Spa, Carmel. There, she met Darryl Brewer, the restaurant's <a href=#>food and beverage</a> manager, and they started dating in 2003.</p><p class=align-left>In February 2006, while still working at the restaurant, she started working for Pre-Paid Legal Services, now LegalShield. Ann's association with the firm made her drift toward the Mormon Church and away from Brewer, eventually breaking up in December 2006.</p><h2>Relationship with Travis Alexander</h2><p class=align-left>Arias met <a href=#>motivational speaker</a>, salesman, and devout Mormon Travis Alexander in September 2006 at a company convention in Las Vegas. At the time, Ann was interested in network marketing opportunities.</p><p class=align-left>However, they hit it off and in no time were in a long-distance relationship. Travis adhered to the Mormon faith principles; therefore, the two lovebirds did not engage in premarital relations.</p><h3>Did Travis Alexander love Jodi Arias?</h3><p class=align-left>Although the two instantly hit it off, after five months of dating, friends of Travis <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> the relationship began to weigh in on him, and they broke up. His friends had reported seeing the relationship become volatile, with one saying Ann showed "obsessive" signs.</p><h3>Aftermath of the breakup</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/314178d1447014a0.jpg><p class=align-left>Despite calling it quits, Jodi moved to Mesa to be closer to Travis. Alexander's friends were baffled by the move and her abrupt appearances at his house, for she knew his code. Alexander had revealed to his friends that Arias had snuck in through the <a href=#>doggy </a>door at one point.</p><p class=align-left>One of Travis' friends revealed that he would sometimes get angry but jump into bed with her at other times. Around the time all this was happening, Travis had started dating another woman.</p><p class=align-left>He would report his car tires being slashed and receiving threatening emails. Nevertheless, Travis would still keep in touch with Ann and have several romantic encounters.</p><h3>Travis Alexander's murder</h3><p class=align-left>Alexander was set to attend a company retreat in Mexico but never got there. His worried friends decided to check up on him and found him dead in his Mesa, Arizona, home on 9 June 2008. He was shot in the head and stabbed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">27 times</a>, and his throat was cut ear-to-ear.</p><p class=align-left>Investigations, including interviews with Alexander's family and friends revealed his strained relationship with Ann. When interviewed, Arias gave different stories, including a story of her and Travis being attacked during a home invasion at his home, eventually leading to his murder. But the police were not buying it.</p><p class=align-left>A damaged digital camera in the home showed several images taken on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">4 June 2008,</a> the day Travis died. Although some showed the two in compromising situations, the most spine-chilling image retrieved showed Travis lying on the bathroom floor, bleeding profusely.</p><p class=align-left>Ann retracted her previous statements after more damning evidence was found, including a bloody palm print on the bathroom hallway with her DNA. She was arrested but claimed it was all in self-defence.</p><h3>Jodi Arias' sentence</h3><p class=align-left>Her trial began on 10 December 2012 in Maricopa County Superior <a href=#>Court</a>. After nearly four months of trial, she was found guilty and was on 8 May 2013 convicted of first-degree murder.</p><p class=align-left>On 13 April 2015, she received a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">life sentence</a> to state prison without the possibility of parole. She serves her term as a high-risk level 5 prisoner at the Arizona Prison Complex in Perryville. Despite being behind bars, she is active on Instagram and often posts her art.</p><h3>Jodi Arias' motive</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/c0d2599db0e1c578.jpg><p class=align-left>Tracy Brown, a former cellmate of Ann, revealed to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Inside Edition</a> that Ann had confessed she intended to kill the lady who had taken Travis away from her. However, most of Jodi Arias' profiles claim she killed Travis because if she could not have him, then no one else would.</p><h2>Where can I watch the Jodi Arias documentary?</h2><p class=align-left>You can watch the documentary on Prime Video and Hulu.
