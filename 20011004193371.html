The two had planned to walk down the aisle at the clifftop estate where Josh’s father James Brolin wed diva Barbra Streisand back in 1998. However, it now seems marriage isn’t on the cards.</p><p id=eDd7_GTOYwrK data-wc=30>“Minnie Driver and Josh Brolin have decided to cancel their wedding plans,” read a statement from the actress’s publicist. “Their decision is mutual and amicable.” No further details were given.</p><p id=eRMFJ-SzPzpL data-wc=55>The <i>Good Will Hunting</i> actress met Josh in 1998 on the set of the straight-to-video flick <i>Slow Burn</i> in which the two co-starred. The pair were soon seen out together with increasing frequency and later announced their engagement in April 2001, despite earlier reports that she’d been spotted canoodling with ’N Sync popstar Joey Fatone.</p><p id=eTkdRLYU0Rn5 data-wc=88>The couple never set a wedding date, but plans were reportedly well under way for the affair which was to cost upwards of £750,000. The notoriously hands-on Barbra had taken over planning duties – much to the chagrin of the <i>Grosse Point Blank</i> star – but there was one item for which Minnie wanted no input: the wedding gown. La Streisand had hoped Minnie would chose a design by her close friend Donna Karan. However, the 31-year-old actress insisted she was going to wear a Vera Wang creation.</p><p id=ebUzfucy4SNA data-wc=37>Minnie, previously linked to actor John Cusack and rocker Taylor Hawkins of the Foo Fighters, was famously dumped by Oscar winner Matt Damon on live TV when he appeared on Oprah Winfrey’s US chat show in 1998.</p><p id=eQFEIOGXn6-Y data-wc=31>This would have been Josh’s second trip to the altar. He married actress Deborah Adair, with whom he has two children, in the late Eighties but the two divorced in 1992.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/film/2001/10/04/minnie/imgs/minnie1a.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/film/2001/10/04/minnie/imgs/minnie2a.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2lpYWV9dX2YbGpwaV%2Bitq%2B6yJ5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
