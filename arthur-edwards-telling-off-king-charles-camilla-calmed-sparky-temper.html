For instance, when they got off, the plane at Northolt the other day. He came down and she stayed back in the cabin until he had met the station commander and then she came down and she's done that all the way. She's never ever hogged the limelight. In fact, she is perfect for him."</p><p id=e4NeOoOvdUhA data-wc=9>He then added: "She never lost her common touch…"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9a80228d4b46-prince-charles-camilla-queen-z.jpg><p id=e_F_FX7ff-lr data-wc=35>Arthur then spoke further about the King.

They are just fabulous people. I really enjoy it. If I've got a job with say the King, the next one will probably be on Wednesday when they follow the coffin. I will look to him, but he will be solid."</p><p id=eDASVJxomZpk data-wc=22></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
