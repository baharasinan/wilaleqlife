"They started following the family. Got in front of them, continuously harassing them. The woman at that time reached for the gun, handed it to the shooter."</p><p>Burkhart was said to have driven alongside the victims at one point, where he fired eight shots into the car.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>Gor was struck once, while the other passengers were unharmed.</p><p>The child was transported to the hospital where he later died.</p><p>Police were able to track Burkhart and his girlfriend Alexandria Gentile, due to the family's car camera.</p><p>"There was a dash cam that picked up part of the plate, and once we had part of the plate, we could track it, and we tracked it to a hotel," law enforcement told local Fox affiliate&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KTTV</a>.</p><p>At the time, the two were arrested on suspicion of murder in a deadly incident.</p><p>After the news broke out, Lancaster&nbsp;Mayor Rex Parris spoke out against the incident.</p><p>"I wish they had shot them at the apprehension. Let's be clear about that. You cannot go into cities and shoot four-year-old children and expect anything resembling due process, and the fact that they got it was unfortunate," he explained in a statement.</p><p>"I'm not a big proponent of the death penalty. But there are some crimes that require something more than what they're giving people because it's getting worse."</p><p>Prosecutors are recommending that Burkhart be held on $5.075 million bail. If he's convicted, he could face life in prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdpbn90f5FxZpqspKS%2Fr7HYZpmyqp%2BjeqPB0aSfmqqkYrCprdGgnJ1loqSupXnRmp6eZZ2qv6Wx0WaeqKpdlrGiudiapWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
