The University of Texas football team has a fan in <strong><a href=#>Beyonce</a></strong>, as evidenced in new photos uploaded to the singer's <a href=#>Tumblr</a> on Tuesday, Dec. 10.</p><p>In the pictures, <strong>Blue Ivy</strong>'s mom, 32, reveals her super-fit physique in a white, string bikini bottom and the college football team's signature blazing orange jersey marked with <strong>David Ash</strong>'s number 14, rolled up to expose her toned, flat tummy. (Texas announced in late November that 21-year-old quarterback Ash was out for the remainder of the season due to concussion-like symptoms.)</p><p>The images of the slimmed-down star were posted one week after <strong><a href=#>Jay Z</a></strong> announced on his Life + Times website that he and his wife were going vegan up until Christmas Day. Beyonce <a href=#>received some flack</a> last Thursday for wearing real fox fur to a vegan lunch in California. However, Tuesday's pics revealed the singer's appreciation for giraffes!</p>&nbsp;<h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Beyonce, in two additional photos, wears a plush giraffe scarf-hat with her hands tucked into its pockets. Another close-up image shows Jay Z's wife wearing minimal eye makeup, as she gives the camera a shocked expression and holds her giraffe paws in front of her chest.</p><p>The "Countdown" crooner also shared an <a href=#>adorable Instagram pic</a> with her 23-month-old daughter on Tuesday. In the photo, the mother-daughter duo are seated on a rug, both wearing Texas jerseys, as Bey hides baby Blue's face with a cowboy hat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGabnamku6SxjJ%2BgrWWSpLG6edOer5qrXaG8r7PHqKmnq12fsrO%2FxLJkm6GbnruqecGoq62nnWK9qq%2FTrqmeZWJlfnR9kGppaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
