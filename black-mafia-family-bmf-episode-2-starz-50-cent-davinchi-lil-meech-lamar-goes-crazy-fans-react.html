The Flenory family is in a proper state with the mother Lucille (Michole Briana White) blaming Meech who doesn't accept it may have been his fault. We see Terry struggle with surgical complications after he was shot in the head and may lose his vision. Things aren't going great on the business front with the crib being compromised forcing the 50 gang to look for a new place to move the stash to.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lamar (Eric Kofi Abrefa) has been making moves on both the family front and trying to make a comeback in business as we see him surprise his adoptive daughter at school, a fact she is shocked by and distances herself from him. He also has been trying to get back in the game and looks to join up with the 12th Street boys. Meech's father is worried about the rest of the family, saying this time Meech has got to go for real or else the rest are going to end up hurt.</p><p>Demetrius meanwhile is on the hunt for the man who attacked Terry and beats up suspects.&nbsp; At the hospital, although the one injured, Terry can only ask about his brother's welfare, with him wanting to still be in the game. But today's, episode belonged to Lamar as we see him go about town attacking people mercilessly and even killing giving off complete mental patient vibes with his shocking behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;A viewer commented, "This n*gga Lamar is nuts he should still be in the psych ward #BMF".
