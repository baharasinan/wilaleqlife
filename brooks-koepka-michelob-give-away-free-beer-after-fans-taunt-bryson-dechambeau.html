It's Brooksy," Koepka said in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video on social media</a> Friday night. "I heard a bunch of you were shouting my name at the golf tournament today. If your time was, I don't know, cut short at the golf tournament today, DM Michelob Ultra and we're going to be giving out 50 cases of beer to the first 50 people … as a thank you for showing your support."</p><p>During the second round Friday, fans were heard shouting Koepka's name at DeChambeau. Koepka is not playing at the Memorial Tournament this week.</p><p>Rumors swirled that DeChambeau asked the jeering fans to be escorted off the course. However, he told reporters, "The officers take care of that. I don't really care."</p><p>When asked if he was bothered by the fans' chants, DeChambeau said it wasn't a big deal.</p><p>"No, it's flattering," he said. "I think that, no matter what, he's a great player and he's won a lot of tournaments and it's like somebody calling me Jack or Payne or Hogan or whatever. I think it's kind of fun."</p><p>Friday's incident is the latest in the ongoing feud between DeChambeau and Koepka. The two golfers<a href=# rel=noopener> recently traded Twitter barbs</a> after TNT announced <a href=# rel=noopener>this summer's edition of The Match golf exhibition</a>, which will pit DeChambeau and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers against Tampa Bay Buccaneers superstar Tom Brady and Phil Mickelson in July.</p><p>Two days before that, a leaked interview from the PGA Championship showed Koepka irritated and cursing about DeChambeau, who walked behind him in the shot.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>(Photo: Andrew Redington / Getty Images)</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Capping off a long day with <a href=#>@MichelobULTRA</a>!
