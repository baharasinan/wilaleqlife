"The terrible trauma you had to go through is beyond my understanding. I hold myself responsible."</p><p>Referring to his history of mental illness, Furrow added that he wished he had been "held at the hospital longer."</p><p>He also said he doesn't "harbor ill feelings toward people of any race, color, creed, religion or sexual orientation."</p><p>"I will never hurt anyone again," he said. "I would give anything for this not to have happened."</p><p>After he finished his statement, victims' family members and a JCC counselor who was shot gave emotional testimony about the day Furrow walked into North Valley Jewish Community Center and opened fire. Minutes later, he killed Joseph Ileto, a Filipino-American postal worker, who was delivering the mail eight miles from the community center.</p><table align=left border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=220><tbody readability=1><tr><td colspan=2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/edition.cnn.com/2001/LAW/03/26/buford.furrow/story.furrow.family.ap.jpg alt="The family of slain mail carrier Joseph Ileto speaks after Furrow's sentencing" width=220 height=168 border=0 hspace=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr readability=2><td><span class=caption><b>The family of slain mail carrier Joseph Ileto speaks after Furrow's sentencing</b></span></td><td width=15>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Furrow looked down during their testimony, glancing up only when new speakers were introduced. One of his attorneys patted him on the knee, trying to comfort him during the session.</p><p>Lillian Ileto, the mother of the slain postal worker, said, "When he killed my son, he also killed a part of me."</p><p>"My son, gunned down like an animal, my heart aches every day. He was killed because he looked Asian or Hispanic," she said, crying. "I don't know if (Furrow) is sorry. But if he is, I don't know if I can really forgive him."</p><p>Ismael Ileto said he misses his brother every day. Glaring at Furrow, he said, "It's a sorry, sorry excuse to say that mental illness caused this."</p><p>Gary Zidell, whose son James was shot by Furrow, said, "I'm disappointed after 19 months we aren't here to watch Mr. Furrow's execution."</p><p>Furrow had pleaded guilty to a murder charge for the shooting of Ileto, six counts of civil rights violations and nine weapons charges.</p><p>Judge Nora Manella sentenced him to two consecutive life terms, plus 110 additional years, without the possibility of parole. Furrow was also ordered to pay $690,294.11 in restitution to victims' families and insurance companies. He must also pay $1,600 to the U.S. government.</p><p>Judge Manella scolded Furrow during the proceeding, saying, "Your actions were a stark and brutal reminder that bigotry is alive, if not well."</p><p>For many in the courtroom, the sentencing seemed empty.</p><p>Eleanor Kadish, whose son Ben was wounded in the shooting, said, "Every night at bath time, we are reminded of that day because of the terrible scarring. Ben asks, 'Why? Why did someone shoot me?' "</p><p>Added Mindy Finkelstein, a teen-aged counselor at the JCC who was shot: "I've been to hell and back. Buford Furrow tried to kill me. He failed, but in a way he succeeded."</p><p>Furrow appeared disheveled as he left the court to begin his prison term.</p><br clear=all><a name=r href=#></a> <span class=FSnBSmDk>RELATED STORIES:</span> <span class=FSnPMdDk><a href=#>Furrow pleads guilty to shootings, will avoid death penalty, get life without parole</a><br>January 24, 2001<br><a href=#>Boy who almost died in L.A. shooting goes home</a><br>September 23, 1999<br><a href=#>5-year-old victim in Jewish center shooting released in good condition</a><br>September 21, 1999<br><a href=#>Suspect in L.A. shooting spree pleads not guilty in murder</a><br>August 30, 1999<br><a href=#>Feds charge Jewish Center shootings suspect with killing postman</a><br>August 19, 1999<br></span><span class=FSnBSmDk>RELATED SITES:</span> <span class=FSnPMdDk><a href=#>Temple Beth Torah of Granada Hills CA</a><br><a href=#>The Los Angeles Police Department</a><br><a href=#>Federal Bureau of Investigation</a><br></span><p>Note: Pages will open in a new browser window</p><span class=FSnPSmDkI>External sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive.</span><br><br clear=all><br></td><td width=10><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.cnn.net/cnn/images/hub2000/1.gif alt width=10 height=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td><td width=1 bgcolor=#999999><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.cnn.net/cnn/images/hub2000/1.gif alt width=1 height=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td><td valign=top bgcolor=#eeeeee><table width=100% border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td bgcolor=#999999><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.cnn.net/cnn/images/hub2000/1.gif alt width=1 height=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr></table><table bgcolor=#000000 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><a href=# class=BlLink><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/edition.cnn.com/LAW/greta.at.law/images/greta.law.logo.gif alt=Greta@LAW width=155 height=23 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></td></tr><tr><td class=pad></td></tr></table><br></td><td width=1 bgcolor=#999999><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.cnn.net/cnn/images/hub2000/1.gif alt width=1 height=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidlJ7BqrvNZ5qnpl6YvK57kWlnamd8dqRwfJJoaW9nkqqzsL7DZ52uqqKkxHC1zZ2csWaYqbqt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
