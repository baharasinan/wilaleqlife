The 68-year-old comedian has joked about sending his wife's legal submissions to his <i>Monty Python</i> colleagues, and quipped that while it's "going to be very, very expensive" it will be "worth every penny."</p><p id=ePg50lE4JRcX data-wc=31>Arriving for Tuesday's hearing in a wheelchair following knee surgery the day before, John was ordered by the judge to temporarily pay his estranged wife, Alice Faye Eichelberger, £77,500 a month.</p><p id=e5fIRrjUJ2dS data-wc=48>Alice, to whom John was married for 15 years, is seeking a £900,000-a-year settlement. She says she's entitled to the sum because her husband was a "world renowned celebrity" and as a result of her marriage she was used to being "entertained by royalty and dignitaries in castles".</p><p id=e2usEphXmNif data-wc=20>John argues her demands are based on his income during a "banner year", where he earned an "unusually high amount."</p><p id=eC725uMhO9Hu data-wc=63>This is the third divorce for the British comedian, whose wives have all been American. He was married to his <i>Fawlty Towers</i> co-writer and co-star, Connie Booth - with whom he had a daughter, Cynthia - for ten years.
