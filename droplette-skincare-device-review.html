And if that doesn't sound scientific enough, NASA provided Droplette with its first round of funding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Droplette team developed the technology after attending a rare disease conference where they learned about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>epidermolysis bullosa</a>, a rare pediatric disease caused by a missing gene. Those with EB have skin that doesn't adhere to the muscle underneath, causing open wounds that are painful to treat with ointments and bandages.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A deeply penetrating mist infused with healing ingredients could treat EB patients without causing discomfort, but as the Droplette team began developing the tool, they realized the technology would be beneficial for the average skincare routine as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to a study by the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>European Food Safety Authority</a>, 90% of topical skincare products don't absorb below the surface of your skin. But Droplette's mist allows for molecules that are up to 10,000 larger than what can typically be topically absorbed into the skin, reaching up to 20 cell layers deep, to better target major skincare concerns such as firmness, uneven texture and tone, and brightness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The brand offers three different capsules: 0.15% retinol for acne, fine lines, or wrinkles; 10% collagen for elasticity and hydration; and 8% glycolic acid for hyperpigmentation, uneven texture, and dullness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All of the serum formulas have been tested by dermatologists and according to the brand, contain percentages of actives that are effective enough to deliver results with minimal risk of irritation despite being delivered deep in the skin. The serums are also vegan, cruelty-free, paraben-free, fragrance-free, and hypoallergenic, and come with a pre-paid envelope to return to Droplette for recycling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: When You Apply Sunscreen in Your Skincare Routine Actually Matters A Lot</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This sounds way too good to be true, right? Well, that's why I reached out to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marisa Garshick</a>, M.D., F.A.A.D., a board-certified dermatologist in New York City (who has no affiliation with the brand), to get her opinion on Droplette's technology.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It is known that the skin barrier is good at protecting the skin and keeping things out. As such, even good ingredients can sometimes have a hard time getting through the skin, so a strong barrier may limit the ability of many of the ingredients we know are valuable to penetrate to get where they need to be to be most effective," she says. "As such, a delivery system that helps improve penetration of key ingredients, as found in Droplette, is definitely a great concept."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With that in mind, Dr. Garshik points out these active mists won't replace or guarantee the results of in-office treatments. "While it definitely looks fun to use, it is important to remember that it is not meant to replace in-office treatments such as chemical peels, lasers, and injectables, but it may provide a great option to incorporate ingredients that are traditionally harder to deliver to the skin," she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although I respect the innovation and technology behind at-home skincare devices, many of the ones I've tried feel like extra work instead of a treat yourself moment. But when I gave Droplette's collagen capsule a shot, I was surprised at how well the device integrated into the rest of my skincare routine.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$299; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>droplette.io</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's how to use it: After cleansing your skin, insert your choice of capsule into the device and turn it on. The mist emits 15 seconds on and 15 seconds off until the serum in the capsule runs out. As it's misting, you run the device over your face about half an inch away. (If you're using the glycolic acid capsule, Droplette recommends holding the device against your skin and closing your eyes and mouth while using it.) After you're done misting your face, finish your routine off with your favorite moisturizer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The collagen capsule definitely gave my face some extra firmness without feeling tight (I did a few eyebrow raises to check). And since the mist really is that fine, my face didn't have that wet, damp feeling I dislike with face mists. When I was done, I was able to move on to the next skincare step without adding any extra time to my routine, and can totally see myself using Droplette a couple times a week or whenever my skin needs an extra boost.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, I guess this officially makes me a face mist person â€” but only if it's micro droplets that penetrate 20 skin cell layers deep.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1om6unoKGytcDEZqqkoZ6YrrOxjJ2cr6GTmnqzsdWinLA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
