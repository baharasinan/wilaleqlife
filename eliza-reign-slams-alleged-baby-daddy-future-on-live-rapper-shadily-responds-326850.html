His two alleged new baby mothers both commented on Future’s lack of presence in his children’s lives but Eliza Reign held nothing back.</p><p>Before going on Instagram Live, she explained to judgemental commentators that she has no beef with any of the other mother’s of Future’s kids and wants her daughter Reign to know her siblings. She also posted the similarities between Reign and Legend, the son of a woman named Cindy who is the latest to join the rapper’s Baby Mama Club.</p><p>Both of the little ones share Future’s last name. He then posted a petty message to his Instagram Story that stated: ‘H*** stole my last name.’</p><p>Fed up with the way that she’s been treated, Reign told her followers: ‘I done been through mental abuse, emotional abuse…he think he got it all. He think he smarter than everybody, I don’t give a f*** about none of the baby mamas. You not gonna keep trying me!’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Lw6ogBW8R/</a></p><p>She also went on to say that she isn’t jealous of vacations or watches because she can buy them for herself.</p><p>Future then posted that she should start a GoFundMe to get a lawyer.</p><p>News recently broke that the model is <a href=#>taking the Mask Off artist to court</a> for child support.</p><p>Things between the two have been rocky since the beginning. Eliza originally told followers that Future made death threats because she wouldn’t abort her pregnancy.</p><p>It seemed that the two found some common ground when the alleged father posted ‘Happy Born Day Kid’ to his Stories the day that baby Reign was born but it went downhill from there when Eliza told followers that he wasn’t a part of her child’s life.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you think that the parents will ever find common ground?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeVoba7rYyrnKKfnmLAra3MrGSapJyatKawjJuYm7Fdma6lsNhmna6spaeybrvNZqOirpViv6K8z56pZquYlrGquNhmqZ6roKS7pb%2BMbGlvcGVlfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
