Her blonde hair was left down and curly with a flower clip placed at the front of her head, and she accessorized with a gold chain that boasted a circular pendant.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9187269cd880-elle-macpherson-bikini.jpg><p id=e1eWjxmaZP data-wc=29>Elle's phenomenal physique has been a talking point ever since she began her modeling career and earned her the nickname, 'The Body', which she said she learned to embrace.&nbsp;</p><p id=esoYB05nP6 data-wc=40><strong>"I never took it personally. I embraced my Amazonian athleticism,"&nbsp;</strong>she told <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO</a>! "I wasn't the 'norm' and there were times when I felt out of place. But I just used it. It's easier to use it than lose it."&nbsp;</p><p id=e_rkaUM3r6C data-wc=35>She added: "It's impossible for us all to fit into one body type! The one thing that never goes out of fashion is health and well-being.

She recently re-shared an interview she did on in which she revealed the secrets to her slim physique and youthful glow.&nbsp;</p><p id=eIHOpVOWVzP data-wc=37>"When I turned 50, I wasn't feeling very well and I wasn't looking very well," she said.

She said I was taking a lot of synthetic vitamins, so she put me on a powerful multivitamin, prebiotic, and probiotic powder.&nbsp;</p><p id=epG-Yd6Lfw data-wc=31>"So, I started taking it because I was kind of malnourished and I wasn't sleeping much, and I wasn't eating enough fruit and vegetables and I was drinking too much coffee.'&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba9f0ddbd781-elle-macpherson-the-body.jpg><p id=eAylHDgMJs data-wc=36>"I saw such a change and my friend, who is now my CEO, said, 'What are you doing you look amazing?' and I told her I was taking this green powder and it's changed my life".&nbsp;</p><p id=eYiN2r__OO data-wc=32>Elle was so inspired by her lifestyle overhaul that she created her own natural supplement company, WelleCo, in 2014 which has since gained cult status thanks to its protein and super-green powders.&nbsp;</p><p id=ett76UhRMy data-wc=52>"I realized the power of taking responsibility for my own health and wellness, and this has since become a foundational core value of WelleCo," she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Sports Edit</a>.
