The actress has snatched herself a younger man — who just so happens to be the inventor of email! <a href=#>The Happily Divorced actress</a> stepped out with her new boyfriend, <strong>Shiva Ayyadurai</strong>, at the premiere of Bridegroom at the Academy Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Tuesday, Oct. 15.</p><p>Drescher, 56, and Ayyadurai, 49, were "very affectionate," an insider revealed to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>. At one point, the former Nanny star grabbed his hand and pulled him in close. "He [gave] her a kiss," the eyewitness added. "They [were] all smiles and [seemed] very into each other and very much in love."</p><p>Ayyadurai developed a full-scale emulation of a mail system he called "EMAIL" as a high school student in 1978 and copyrighted it in 1982. (<a href=#>Gizmodo</a> published an article in March 2012 questioning the accuracy of these claims.)</p><p>Drescher revealed that she loves to cook with the Indian-American scientist and they are currently throwing around ideas for a couple-themed Halloween costume. "I don't think we've decided yet but we know what we're doing. We've got some really good parties to go to and Iron & Wine, which is one of my favorite bands, is playing down at the Orpheum so we're gonna be doing all that," <a href=#>the Queens native added.</a> "I can't do anything but sexy so we gotta work along those lines."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Drescher revealed in November 2012 that dating a younger man doesn't bother her at all — in fact, she actually prefers it. "[I've] got a lot of energy and a lot of contemporary taste in music or whatever, so I have more in common with guys who are younger," she told <a href=#>HuffPost Live</a>. "I'm trying to keep it within ten years now. Definitely younger."&nbsp;</p><p>Drescher was married to her high school sweetheart<strong> Peter Marc Jacobson</strong> for 21 years until their divorce in 1999. In 2010, the exes confirmed that Jacobson is now an openly gay man, and the two <a href=#>continue to be the best of friends.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ2rmZ5isbOx0pyfnqpdqMGmvNJmpq6sXay2tbSMp5ywZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWWjnba3rYyasLKZlKq%2ForWMnqSaoZxitq%2FCxKerqKpdpLNuscyaoKVloJ6wtcHRnmRraGFofnd9jw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
