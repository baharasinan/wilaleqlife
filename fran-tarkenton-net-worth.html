His professional football career started when he was selected in the 1961 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings, for whom he played until 1966 before being signed by the New York Giants, playing for them until 1971. He then returned to the Minnesota Vikings, and played there until he retired as a footballer in 1978.

Only one other NFL quarterback has rushed for at least 300 yards in seven different seasons.
