"There's like, a Cirque du Soleil performance," she said of her bump. "It's like alien stuff." The actress joked about whether random people were "manhandling" her on the streets by rubbing her tummy. "I've been spared, I have been!" she exclaimed, though she added, "I feel a little less loved…"</p><p>Kimmel then asked her about her recent wedding to Once costar Josh Dallas. As reported, the couple <a href=#>married in an intimate ceremony</a> on April 12. "We wrapped production on Once Upon a Time, I think, two weeks ago," Goodwin recalled to Kimmel. "And a couple days later, I was wed in Venice, California."</p><p>"I married Prince Charming," she added. "We're both Southern, so I was literally barefoot and pregnant at our wedding. I was afraid I would fall over, I don't know what I was thinking."</p><p>"Were the parents mad you got pregnant first and then married?" Kimmel inquired. "No, no," Goodwin replied. "We may be Southern, but that's their first grandchild," she explained. "They're all coming back out here in a couple of weeks to camp out and wait," Goodwin said of her in-laws and parents anticipating the baby's birth.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>Something Borrowed actress</a> proceeded to ask Kimmel if she was the most pregnant star who's ever been on his show.</p><p>"Let's see," he responded. "No, Octomom!"</p><p>Laughing, Goodwin quipped, "No, definitely she's more pregnant… that's impressive."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJ6ipp6es6a%2BjKCmqJynnrtuwMCloqxlkaG2prqMqamen56Wu6TFjLCcnZyZo7RuwM5moairmGKxorjLmqpmamBmgXOAkw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
