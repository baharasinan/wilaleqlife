To enter, participants have to <a class=body-link href=# title=www.haighschocolates.com.au>reveal their favourite </a>Haigh’s Christmas tradition in 30 words or less.</p><p>The competition closes at 11.59pm on November 13 and entrants must be in Australia.</p><p>“This year’s calendar celebrates more than 107 years of Haigh’s Chocolates and our very first store which opened at Beehive Corner in 1915,” CEO Alister Haigh said at the time of the calendar’s release.</p><p>“The decorative box design captures the beauty of the heritage-listed building with sophisticated detail and complements the selection of premium quality chocolates found inside each drawer.”</p><p>Last year, the cost didn’t put off shoppers either, with the calendar also selling out.</p><p>“When we launched the Luxury Advent Calendar last year we were overwhelmed with the positive feedback we received and it was a great success for our entire team,” Mr Haigh said.</p><p>“Our ongoing commitment to deliver world-class chocolate sees us continually evolve our product range to ensure we are creating the finest chocolates year-round. Our chocolatiers’ artisan skill shines through in every chocolate crafted for this unique calendar.</p><p>“You and loved ones will enjoy experiencing exciting hidden delights in the days leading up to Christmas. We can’t wait to share it with our customers.”</p><p>However shoppers online were divided over the high price for the advent calendar.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“I disagree with it being overpriced. This is a luxury item. Limited in edition. They have the cheaper version for $24.50 as well. Haigh’s Chocolate is absolutely worth the price,” one person said.</p><p>Another said: “The chocolates in here sound amazing.”</p><p>But a third wrote: “I love Haigh’s Chocolates but that’s not within [the] average person’s budget no matter how nice they are. Why not do a $119 version with one or two chocs per drawer?”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label="Christmas Shopping" data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Christmas Shopping</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8Wopp1nlZbBcLTAop6hq12YtbCvzqWYrZ1dZn9xfIylrLGtoq56orDVnqWtZZOWuaa6w5qpZquVobm0ec6uq2imlazAbr%2FTqKmyZ2Bnrqd8wm%2Bda5pia312r5VtmW9waWV%2BpH2XnZ1pa2Vl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
