The ‘Stan’ rapper does have a younger half-brother called Nathan Kane Samra, who he took custody of after Samra was put into foster care as a child.</strong></p><p>Read more about NF and learn why he sounds so much like Eminem.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Does NF Sound Like Eminem?</h2><p>NF has been compared to Marshall Mathers since he first hit the scene in the early 2010s, although they are not related NF is a huge fan of the rapper, and told<a href=# class=rank-math-link rel=noopener> Idolator</a> that he “pretty much just listened to Eminem for six years.”</p><p>The rapper for born in Gladwin, Michigan,&nbsp; released the indie debut album ‘Moments’ in 2010 before being signed in 2014 by<a href=# rel=noopener> Capitol Christian Music Group</a>. NF has since distanced himself from this Christian rapper pigeonhole. Growing up in Michigan, he found an escape and an emotional outlet in the hip-hop music of the likes of Eminem after years of physical abuse and the traumatic death of his mother. It’s this tragic upbringing that makes fans connect so much to his music, but it’s also something that connects the young star to Eminem.</p><p>His 2017 release, “Perception,” debuted at No. 1 and less than two years later his album hit the top again, beating our<a href=# rel=noopener> Chance the Rapper</a> and<a href=# rel=noopener> Ed Sheeran</a>. His love for Eminem has been worn like a badge of honor over the year,<a href=# rel=noopener> Tweeting</a> in 2017 “I can’t respect anyone that says Eminem is wack period.”</p><p>During an interview with<a href=# rel=noopener> NME</a>, NF named his top 5 Eminem’s tracks: “As far as top 5 Eminem songs, I’d say “<a href=# rel=noopener>The Way I Am</a>” that song is ridiculous. I think Eminem Show is one of the best albums ever. “<a href=# rel=noopener>White America</a>,” “<a href=# rel=noopener>Cleanin’ Out My Closet</a>,” “<a href=# rel=noopener>Sing For The Moment</a>,” there is so many dope songs, I don’t know…”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>It is clear, to anyone who has heard his album, that NF uses the same polysyllabic rhymes and self-deprecated lyrics as Eminem, both of the rappers writing songs about their feelings and points of views. This style of flow harkens back to the 1990s style of rapping, that called attention to its own flamboyance, never compromising on melody and passion.</p><p>Eminem has certainly left a space in the mainstream hip-hop industry that someone like NF is perfect to fill.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Eminem like NF?</h2><p>Eminem was apparently not happy with the number of comparisons between him and the young rapper. Marshall Mathers took aim at the younger artist on his track ‘The Ringer’.</p><p>“It’ll help me get back to myself and she’ll love me (ooh-ooh)</p><p>I mailed the b**** back and said if I did that</p><p>I’d just be like everyone else in the f****** industry</p><p><strong>Especially aN eFfing Recovery clone of me”</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The last line has led fans to believe Eminem is calling NF a clone of him during the period he released his album ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>Recovery</a>’. Aside from being two Michigan white rappers, their style of writing and delivering the music is very similar, they share a similar logo and even look as if they could be related. Eminem, on his ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>Kamikaze</a>’ record, famously started feuds with a number of artists, making it almost a compliment to be noticed by the rapper.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Final Words</h2><p>Despite both being compared in the press and by rap fans, Eminem and NF are not related. Although Eminem does have a younger half-sibling called Nathan, it is not Nathan John Feuerstein (NF). His actual half-sibling, Nathan Mathers, has tried rapping under the moniker Nate Kane and released a song entitled ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>Shadow of a Celebrity’</a> which unfortunately bombed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZqaWYr%2BmuMCtnJ1lpKR6prnIp5ymZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
