Over the years, the competition has generated global superstars, a desire that many contemporary candidates auditioning for the program share.&nbsp;Fan-favorite celebrity judges Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel, Sofia Vergara, and Heidi Klum return to fascinate audiences with their unique and engaging personalities, hosted by Terry Crews.</p><h2>More Details About Jack Williams’ America’s Got Talent audition</h2><p>Heidi Klum first assumed Jack was a magician since he had a covered black box on a table next to him. The competitor, however, corrected her before greeting fellow ventriloquist Sofia Vergara, who began her career voice puppet as Gloria Delgado-Pritchett on the ABC series Modern Family.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jack-Williams-2.jpg alt="Jack Williams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He then got out his rabbit puppet, Foster, and started the performance. Foster and Jack demonstrated their abilities in front of the crowd to decide who is a better ventriloquist. In an attempt to win, Jack tosses the puppet’s voice into the theater, which bounces back at him.&nbsp;Both the judges and the audience were taken aback by Jack’s accuracy and ability to differentiate his voice from Foster’s. The competitor subsequently said that he was inspired by the show’s Season 2 winner, Terry Factor, and admitted that he had “large shoes to fill.”</p><p>“Terry was one of the first ventriloquists I ever saw, and when I saw him on this stage, all I could think was, ‘I simply want to do that, that’s wonderful.'” That is why I decided to come here today. “I’d want to perform this live on the Las Vegas strip.”</p><h2>Before auditioning for America’s Got Talent, what was Jack Williams doing?</h2><p>Before applying for America’s Got Talent, Jack Williams had worked as a ventriloquist for ten years, performing in clubs and theaters throughout the Midwest, as well as on the Los Angeles club circuit.&nbsp;In late 2021, Jack became popular for demonstrating how he could “delay” his voice while speaking, mouthing the words first and then speaking a few seconds afterward. He amassed over 1 million TikTok followers after getting popular on numerous social media sites.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jack-Williams-3.jpg alt="Jack Williams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The competitor has also been on Rhett James McLaughlin and Charles Lincoln’s “LinkYouTube “‘s a channel on their famed program, Good Mythical Morning, in a video with over 2 million views.
