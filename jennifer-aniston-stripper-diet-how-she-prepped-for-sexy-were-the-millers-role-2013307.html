In her new comedy We're the Millers, the 44-year-old went on a strict diet to get into even better shape than she usually is to play a stripper.</p><p>"I was on a very like, you know, greens and vegetables and lean proteins and kale," Aniston told <a href=# rel=noopener>Access Hollywood</a> of her diet plan. But the Friends star adds that she "did eat" on the day of her big stripping scene, where she strips into lingerie in front of costars <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jason Sudeikis</strong></a>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Emma Roberts</a> </strong>and <strong>Will Poulter</strong>. "When I really wanted to have a cheat day," she said, "I had to have a kale chip."</p><p>In addition to eating right, Aniston also had to focus on getting an injured knee ready to handle the sexy moves. "It wasn't easy because I'd just had knee surgery a month and a half before. It was a little bit tedious. And then also just getting trained physically — I was really in shape then," she told <a href=# rel=noopener>USA Today</a>. "I was in the kind of shape I don't enjoy being in because it feels a little too fit."'</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Justin Theroux</strong></a>'s fiancee still needs to have another knee surgery done "in a about a month." "I have a hole in a tendon that's leaking fluid," she shared. "Is that pleasant? It hurts. It feels creepy. But let's not talk about that."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Even though she got her body into amazing shape to strip in the <strong>Rawson Marshall Thurber</strong>-directed film, Aniston was still nervous that her "kibbles and bits" would accidentally be exposed — so she doubled up on lingerie!</p><p>"I had no taping. I really just doubled my bras. I had a thong and then two pairs of underwear," Aniston told Access Hollywood. "Why I thought that was going to help protect anything is beyond me. Because, that's just like ridiculous . . . I was like, 'No, I need three bras! I need three bras because God forbid that one, if it's gonna escape!'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WaYp6GjqbyvedKtqaKooJq%2FbrDInqtmoJ%2BserS0xGanq52gpbKlecWoqWarla3GbsPEq5xmrJiaeq61y6Wcq6tdp7ytsYxrZ2prY2WEcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
