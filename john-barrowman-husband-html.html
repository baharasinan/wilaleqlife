In the video, Noel Clarke alleged that Barrowman took “his [expletive]&nbsp;out every five minutes.”</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Clarke also asked&nbsp;his co-star Camille Coduri if she remembered&nbsp;“that time he put it on your shoulder in the makeup truck?” to which she responded with, “Yes, I do.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Barrowman later addressed the claims by denying all the accusations. He, however,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">admitted to “tomfoolery”</a> on the set of the BBC show. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The&nbsp;Torchwood actor was involved in a similar incident back in 2008. He reportedly had to apologize&nbsp;after pulling down his trousers during an interview with BBC Radio 1.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>At the time, he explained himself by&nbsp;saying that he had joined in “the light-hearted and fun banter of the show” but “went too far.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Meanwhile, despite all the backlash and accusations,&nbsp;Barrowman and his husband have stayed strong.</p><p></p><p><strong>John Barrowman with his husband Scott Gill.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As stated earlier, Gill even thanked the people who trusted them and sent supportive messages during their challenging times.&nbsp;</p><p>“To all of you who have sent us lovely messages - THANK YOU!” the actor’s longtime partner noted in his Instagram post.</p><h2>John Barrowman and Scott Gill Together since 1991</h2><p>Barrowman and&nbsp;Gill have been together since they first met at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 1991.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun</a>, they were introduced by a friend, as Gill had come to see&nbsp;Barrowman&nbsp;in a production of Rope. On the other hand, the actor instantly fell in love with his now-husband.</p><p>The tabloid further reported that&nbsp;Barrowman&nbsp;claimed he knew he had found the man “he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The gay couple&nbsp;soon started their relationship, and eventually&nbsp;entered into a civil partnership on December 27, 2006,&nbsp;at St David’s Hotel in Cardiff, Wales.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Moreover, they were also&nbsp;among the first people to legally marry in the state of California, after gay marriage was made legal on July 2, 2013. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the following year, they had been regularly spotted together at various events and through their social media handles.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance,&nbsp;Barrowman dedicated his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram post</a> to his husband on December 28, 2020. He made the post to mark their anniversary.</p><p>“I’m off to make coffee and put icing on my buns...Lol Happy Anniversary to us!
