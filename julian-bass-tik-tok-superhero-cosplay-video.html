He also posted a video set to One Direction singer Harry Styles and&nbsp;Watermelon Sugar, which went viral in no time. The Tik Tok video has accumulated 5.7 million views as of now. On Twitter, it already had collected the views of more than 10 million,&nbsp;300,000 retweets, and&nbsp;650,000 million likes.</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/Trending/julian-bass-disney-cosplay.jpg alt width=450 height=449 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span><strong>(©: Twitter/Julian Bass)</strong></span></p><p><span>On the Twitter post, Bass jokingly wrote, 'if y'all can retweet this enough times that Disney calls, that'd be greatly appreciated.'
