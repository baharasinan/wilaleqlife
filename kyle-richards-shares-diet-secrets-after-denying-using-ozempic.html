After<a href=#><strong> Kyle Richards</strong></a> shut down speculation that <a href=#>she used weight loss drug Ozempic to slim down</a>, the reality TV star is revealing how she actually dropped the pounds.</p><p class=p1>“I changed my eating after we were in Europe for a month,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&nbsp;</i></a>personality, 54, said during a Thursday, January 19, <a href=#>Amazon Live</a> session. “We were in Europe for three weeks and then Australia for a week, and I had gained weight, and I was like, ‘OK, that’s it.’ No sugar, no carbs, no alcohol.”</p><p class=p1>While Richards only <a href=#>planned to cut out sugar, carbs and alcohol</a> for a “little while,” she decided to stick with the new diet because she felt “so good.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Kyle-Richards-Reveals-Secret-to-Slimmed-Down-Physique-After-Denying-Using-Weight-Loss-Drug-Ozempic-1.jpg><p class=p1>She added: “Now that I’ve already lost the weight I wanted to lose — I’m not trying to lose anymore — I, of course, will have birthday cake or some pasta, but actually, to be honest, once in a blue moon. I am not following the keto diet, just basically, I eat protein, vegetables, fruit and carbs once in a while. But I <a href=#>do eat fruits and vegetables all the time</a>, and I really love cereal.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Halloween Ends&nbsp;</i>actress has also <a href=#>maintained her figure with a variety of exercises</a>.</p><p class=p1>“My workout routine, I shake it up — I do something different every day,” Richards said on Thursday. “I<a href=#> do the Peloton</a>, a very <a href=#>long, extensive ab routine</a>. I’m now doing weights. I always did light weights, but now I’ve increased my weights that I’m lifting. And then I will run, either outside or — depending on the weather — I will run on the treadmill.”</p><p class=p1>The former child star came under fire earlier this month after <a href=#>her ab-bearing bikini selfie sparked criticism</a> that she had used Ozempic to lose weight. (According to the <a href=#>U.S. Food and Drug Administration&nbsp;</a>(FDA), Ozempic is a medication that is commonly used for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or who are overweight with a weight-related condition, including h<a href=#>igh blood pressure or type 2 diabetes</a>.) Richards swiftly denied the accusations.</p><p class=p1>“I am NOT taking Ozempic. Never have,” she <a href=#>wrote via an Instagram comment</a> on Monday, January 16. “I have never tried Ozempic and this is not from plastic surgery. I did have a&nbsp;breast reduction in May.&nbsp;I’m honest about what I do. But if giving plastic surgery the credit makes you feel better then pop off sister&nbsp;<span class=s1>😘</span>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Richards — who <a href=#>had her breast reduction in May 2022</a> — has been candid about the plastic surgery she’s done, including <a href=#>two nose jobs</a> and liposuction.</p><p class=p1>“After having four kids, no matter what exercise I did, the love handles wouldn’t go away,” she exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in 2012 of <a href=#>her decision to get liposuction</a>. “I’m very happy with the results!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaksZyaerO1wqGYq5yjYsCprdGeqmacmZrBbr%2FEnKmerKNirqfAxKtknZ2erravs4yuqqKml2K8u7HMqaCcZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
