Later on, Kevin liked his wife's post, proving how much the couple stand up for each other's important work across the industry and online.</p><p id=eLBDq7BsAMuW data-wc=64>The couple have also recently been uniting to work on the 57-year-old's social media campaign to help her followers <a class=hm-link href=#>combat a low mood</a> over the weekend.
