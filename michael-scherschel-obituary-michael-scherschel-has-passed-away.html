Father Mike’s journey was marked by his dedication to his calling as a pastor, a servant leader, and a cherished member of his community. Serving as the pastor of the recently merged SS. Matthew and Hubert parishes in Hoffman Estates and Schaumburg, Illinois, he embodied the essence of his faith through his actions and interactions with all those he encountered.</p><p>As the cherished son of Dorothy Jean and the late Frank Joseph Scherschel, of Cary, Illinois, and the loving brother of Julie, Wendy, Kathy, Pam, and Jenny, Father Mike’s influence extended beyond his congregation. He was a beloved uncle to 17 nieces and nephews and a great uncle to 3, leaving an indelible mark on his family that will forever be cherished. Father Mike’s impact extended far beyond his familial connections. He was a dear friend, mentor, and a source of inspiration to countless individuals whose lives he touched through his service in the priesthood.</p><p>His leadership, compassion, and dedication resonated deeply with those who had the privilege of knowing him, leaving an imprint that will forever be felt. The visitation on August 16th and 17th and the prayer services at St. Hubert Catholic Church are a testament to the impact Father Mike had on his community. It is a time for those who were touched by his presence to come together to honor his memory, share stories, and find solace in the bonds of community and faith.</p><p>As we mourn the loss of Reverend Michael George Scherschel, may his memory serve as a reminder of the importance of compassion, faith, and service.
