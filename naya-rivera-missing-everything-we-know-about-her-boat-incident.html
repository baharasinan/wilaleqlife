The pair, who wed in July 2014, <a href=#>surprised fans with their decision to tie the knot</a> just three months after her <a href=#>split</a> from <a href=#><strong>Big Sean</strong></a>. (Rivera and the 32-year-old rapper called off their engagement in April 2014.)</p><p>The Step Up: High Water star later revealed in her 2016 memoir that she briefly dated Dorsey, 36, before she met Sean.</p><p>“By the time we sort of reconnected, I was like, gosh, there’s a reason why you keep coming back in my life and we keep coming back together,” Rivera wrote of Dorsey in her 2016 book, Sorry Not Sorry.</p><p>Rivera and Dorsey’s marriage nearly came to an end in November 2016 when she filed for divorce. While <a href=#>they later reconciled</a>, their relationship hit another rough patch in November 2017 when Rivera was arrested after an alleged altercation with Dorsey. After the<a href=#> actress subsequently filed for divorce for the second time</a>, the domestic battery charges against her were dropped as Dorsey decided not to press charges.</p><p>While<a href=#> their divorce was finalized in June 2018,</a> the twosome continued to coparent Josey. The day before Rivera brought her son to the lake on July 8, she<a href=#> shared a sweet snap with the little boy via Instagram.</a></p><p>“Just the two of us,” she captioned a photo of her kissing her son.</p><p>As fans flooded the comments section of Rivera’s post with positive thoughts, <a href=#>another one of Rivera’s social media posts went viral.</a></p><p>“No matter the year, circumstance, or strifes [every day] you’re alive is a blessing,” Rivera wrote on July 2 via Twitter. “Make the most of today and every day you are given. tomorrow is not promised.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll through for everything we know about Rivera’s accident — including the lawsuit her ex filed in November:</p><p>With reporting by Marjorie Hernandez and Kayley Stumpe</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNku6LFwGapoq6Vp65uucisqqKml2Kyt7HRsquhoZ6cerixjKSlqK9dlq%2BwwdNmn56qXZe8osCMoqWcoZSau7V7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
