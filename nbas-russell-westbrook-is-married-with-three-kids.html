Here’s a peek into their beautiful family.</strong></p><p>33-year-old Russell Westbrook is one of the standout players for the Los Angeles Lakers. Westbrook’s time with the team has been largely successful and rewarding.&nbsp;</p><p>Westbrook was a member of the NBA’s 75th Anniversary Team and a nine-time NBA All-Star. In addition, the Lakers hitman earned the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for the 2016–17 season.</p><p>However, Westbrook’s greatest fulfillment comes from his family, despite his successful career. The NBA star is happily married to his wife, Nina, and they share three children: his son,<strong> Noah</strong>, and twins, <strong>Skye</strong> and <strong>Jordan.</strong></p><p>The Los Angeles Lakers point guard, and his wife met long ago before becoming the global stars they are today. The couple met at the University of California during a college basketball game.</p><p>Westbrook proposed to Nina in 2014, shortly after they began dating, and the couple walked down the aisle a year later. <a href=#>Their relationship</a> has gone on to experience many high moments.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=a-lovely-family><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_LOVELY_FAMILY></span>A LOVELY FAMILY<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Russell Westbrook’s wife, Nina, wasted no time in embracing motherhood. Two years after their marriage, the couple announced the birth of their son, Noah. Their twin daughters, Skye and Jordan, joined the family two years later.</p><p>Russell Westbrook’s kids are obviously a big part of his life. From his social media posts, one could tell that the basketball starman enjoys being a dad. Westbrook wastes no time sharing pictures from his bonding time with his family.</p><p>The California native shared a stunning photo of his family last December wishing his fans a Merry Christmas. Westbrook captioned the <a href=#>post</a>, “ Silly faces on 3… Merry Christmas from my family to yours.” Seeing the cute snap, fans could not help but notice how bonded the family is.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CX6g1mbJWTk/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=russell-westbrook-s-wife-nina><span class=ez-toc-section id=RUSSELL_WESTBROOKS_WIFE_NINA></span>RUSSELL WESTBROOK’S WIFE, NINA<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nina is undeniably a loving mother to her children and a devoted wife to her husband, but she is much more than that. The mom of three has other sides to her life that are equally successful. Russell Westbrook’s wife enjoys a career as a businesswoman and a family therapist.</p><p>When not found in the midst of her family, the 33-year-old could be seen running her two companies: <a href=#>Minibrook </a>and <a href=#>Bene</a>. Minibrook aims to provide young children with comfortable and adventurous everyday outfits, while Bene is based on her qualification as a family therapist</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ku6Ot0maprqujmrmtedaeqq2aoqS8rHnIrGSmmaKntqawjLCgraBdqbWzscRmoqKco2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
