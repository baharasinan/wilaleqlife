This is the second track on the band’s highly anticipated sixth studio album, This is Why, which comes out February 10, 2023.</p><p>The music video for “The News” was inspired by the band’s favorite horror movies and thrillers, and was filmed in their hometown of Nashville, TN, directed by Mike Kluge and Matthew DeLisi.</p><p>The theme goes well with the song, as the lyrics unleash the feelings of helplessness and anxiety that come with a desire to stay informed and engaged with current events, along with the emotional toll of being overwhelmed by the 24 hour news cycle.</p><p>“”The News” is one of those songs that came together pretty quickly and felt exciting from the start,” Hayley Williams shared. “It feels like a happy medium between classic Paramore angst and bringing in some influences we’ve always had but never exploited. Watching Zac track drums for this one was one of my favorite memories from the studio.”</p><p>“Lyrically, it probably explains itself. The 24-hr news cycle is just impossible to comprehend. And I feel a pang of guilt when I unplug to protect my headspace. The common reaction, or non-reaction, seems to be dissociation. Not one of us is innocent of that and who could blame us?”</p><p>On top of a new album, Paramore is going on a global tour, is headlining the kick-off of the Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest in Glendale, AZ on Feb 9th, and will join Taylor Swift on the opening night of her Eras Tour on March 17th. The band will also be doing a special, intimate album release show for fans on February 6th at The Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville!</p><p>The global tour is kicking off in South America in March, followed by a UK run in April, and a North American run starting in May. The band is donating a portion of their ticket sales to organizations working in areas of essential community support, including Support & Feed.</p><p><strong>Check out all of their upcoming tour dates here:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>https://www.paramore.net/tour</a></p><p><strong>Watch the music video for “The News” below:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Do you like the new song?
