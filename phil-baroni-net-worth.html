As of early-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $500,000, mostly earned through a successful career in mixed martial arts, which he then transitioned into a professional wrestling career. He earned 15 wins during his mixed martial arts career, and has also done commentary work. As he continues his endeavors, it is expected that his wealth will continue to increase.</p><h3>Phil Baroni Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Phil attended Massapequa High School, and was part of the school’s wrestling team; however, he was expelled from the school after assaulting the janitor.

He would gain a rematch against Lidland but lost and would then fight <a href=#>Evan Tanner</a> at “UFC 45”. His loss there was controversial as he thought the referee was asking him if he wanted to continue but was actually asking him if he wanted to quit. This led him to strike the official, drawing a suspension for 4 months. A rematch against <a href=#>Tanner</a> after his suspension resulted in another loss. He then lost against Pete Sell, tapping out to a guillotine choke.</p><p>Phil then joined Hammer House, then Japan’s PRIDE Fighting Championships promotion.

He then had a feud with <a href=#>Frank Shamrock</a> and would lose in their fight held in 2007. He was locked in a rear naked choke during the second round and lost consciousness, giving the victory to Shamrock. He was then suspended for six months, after the California State Athletic Commission found that Baroni had tested positive for anabolic steroids. In 2008, he fought for the ICON Sport Middleweight title against Kala Hose, but lost in the fifth round via TKO. His next fight would be as part of EliteXC, against Joey Villasenor. The fight was broadcasted on CBS and he lost in the opening round via TKO, making it his second consecutive TKO loss.</p><p>Baroni then made his Cage Rage debut against Jansen which he would win, but then lost against <a href=#>Joe Riggs</a> in his second Strikeforce appearance. In 2009, he returned to the UFC, and would fight against Amir Sadollah but lost. He trained in Muay Thai in Phuket, and would get back into shape. His next match would be at “UFC 125” against Brad Tavares which he lost, and was released by the UFC with a record of 3-7. He then signed with Titan Fighting Championships and would win against Nick Nolte, then after shoulder surgery he would fight&nbsp;Chris Holland in 2012, losing via TKO in the second round. After a few months, he joined ONE Fighting Championship to face Yoshiyuki Yoshida which he lost, and underwent further shoulder surgery once again.</p><p>After a few more fights for ONE Championship, he signed with Bellator MMA and lost against Karo Parisyan, and was then released from the promotion.</p><p>Since then, he’s occassionally worked as an MMA Commentator.
