Then when I met him, we hadn’t been together that long and I said, ‘Remember that NDA you signed when you photographed my son? You know that still holds … because I’m bringing a child home when I come back from Toronto,’” the Proposal star explained. “He was so happy, but he was scared. I’m a bulldozer. My life was already on the track and here’s this beautiful human being who doesn’t want anything to do with my life but [was] the right human being to help me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sandra-Bullock-Says-Coparenting-With-Bryan-Randall-Can-Be-Hard-We-Dont-Always-Agree-0002.jpg><p>The Golden Globe winner added that coparenting with the former model can be “hard” since she wants to “do everything [her]self” sometimes.</p><p>“He’s the example that I would want my children to have,” Bullock told hosts <a href=#><strong>Willow Smith</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jada Pinkett Smith</strong></a> and<strong> Adrienne Banfield-Norris</strong>. “I have a partner who’s very Christian and there are two different ways of looking at things. I don’t always agree with him, and he doesn’t always agree with me. But he is an example even when I don’t agree with him. … We’re saying it differently but we mean the exact same thing.”</p><p>The Blind Side star <a href=#>began dating Randall in 2015</a>, five years after <a href=#>splitting</a> from ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Jesse James</strong></a>. Bullock adopted Louis and Laila in 2010 and 2015, respectively, and Randall has a daughter named Skylar <a href=#>from a previous relationship</a>.</p><p>Their family dynamic is “the best thing ever,” Bullock said on Tuesday, explaining, “I don’t need a paper to be a devoted partner, a devoted mother. I don’t need to be told to be ever present. I don’t need to be told to weather the storm with a good man.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In November 2020, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that there was <a href=#>“no pressure on either side” to tie the knot.</a></p><p>“They’re lucky to have each other and that it doesn’t take a piece of paper or formality to ensure happiness. They’re open to having more kids, too, but again it’s not front and center of their agenda,” the insider explained at the time, calling Randall a “model stepfather.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasmZ6Zv6J5wa6jpaeToHqmxM%2BlmKKmo2LEqcWMnKapmaKau7W1zaBksKGknXqjvtiapWaqkaOxorjLZqCsZZiWv6V7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
