Last night, out of the blue, I found this picture. I guess it meant I had to share it on your special day. It made me think back to a time when they said we wouldn’t make it. Then they said we wouldn’t last. Keep shining chica and keep enjoying every second of it!"&nbsp;</p><p id=eVA6KJEZdd data-wc=23>Along with Susan, Salma and the birthday girl herself, other famous faces in the image included Ben Affleck and the late Ed Limato.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/305e3244691b-susan-sarandon-at-home.jpg><p id=efdzulv8mZ data-wc=31>Fans were quick to remark on the iconic photo, with one writing: "This needs to be recreated!" while another wrote: "What an iconic photo." A third added: "This is too incredible!"</p><p id=eiUoWFHN4rO data-wc=25>Susan has never felt more confident than she does now in her seventies, having spoken out about ageing gracefully in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Harper's Bazaar</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAfPhZhWvp data-wc=57>She said: "When your sense of time has an ending and isn’t finite, like how it feels when you're young – when you have an understanding that time is precious – you have a tendency not to waste energy on the small stuff and only to surround yourself with people who are vital, curious, brave and adventurous.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4b7b48049e75-susan-sarandon-a.jpg><p id=eJiDCX4FY0 data-wc=59>"Some of my friends are quite young and fall in that category, and some of them are my age or in-between. You just don’t suffer fools lightly anymore. People who don’t contribute to a healthy, fun and adventurous life… well, there's no reason to waste your time on them and you definitely appreciate that when you reach your 70s."&nbsp;</p><p id=e12KeEt6rG data-wc=36>What's more, the Thelma and Louise actress has observed the change in the industry over the decades, recalling what it used to be like on the red carpets at star-studded events, and how they have altered.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2a503eaf571a-susan-sarandon-striking.jpg><p id=ecNX0CtHhp data-wc=41>She remembers how she was told she had been nominated for her first Oscar (Best Actress in 1981’s Atlantic City), via a voicemail left on her phone, as she didn’t have a publicist or agent to relay the news to her.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUVcm3l4ii data-wc=55>"I've gone from having fun, to wearing heels and flats with socks and wearing a lot of vintage '40s stuff, to this big corporate thing. Now, it's very different. The models don’t seem to be having as much fun. They look very bored. Back in the day models were lively and having so much fun."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f6c362ee3d22-susan-sarandon-a.jpg><p id=euiEptdFZM data-wc=38>Susan uses her voice for the greater good and is known for her work in political activism alongside her acting roles. She is one of the many A-listers protesting right now in the ongoing Sag-Aftra strike in Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEHEI_AfIg data-wc=20>George Clooney, Matt Damon, Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick have also been taking part among the many other famous faces.</p><p id=eg0KRW4GwU data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
