He loves to play with her for five minutes, and then he’s kind of over it. But he’s a good big brother. He helps her a lot, which is nice.”</p><p>The couple’s youngest is reaching many new milestones, she added. “She’s sitting up now, which is really nice when she wants to. She’s kind of a princess. She’s like, ‘I’d rather have somebody hold me up.’ But she’s talking a lot, babbling, loves her brother. She’s moving everywhere. You can’t put her down anymore.”</p><p>As for their toddler, Jackson is “pretty good” behavior-wise, but “asks the same question over and over again.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Little People, Big World airs on TLC Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatp6KeerutwqFkq6ecpLOnecCrnGamn6l6sLqMrZ%2BeZaOWuqZ5z5qenmWRl7y2wIxsqZ1lkpavur%2BMraCmoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
