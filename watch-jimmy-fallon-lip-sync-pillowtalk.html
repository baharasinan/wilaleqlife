Lip syncing ‘PILLOWTALK’ is pretty cool in and of itself, but the dedication with which Jimmy did it was truly astounding. The choreography was incredible and we can only hope that Zayn Malik himself is taking some ideas from Jimmy when he starts touring.</p><p>Squirming around on the floor and getting into the fetal position for the chorus, Jimmy’s moves may seem a bit laughable – but we have no doubt that Zayn could easily pull it off, making it look as effortlessly sexy as basically everything else he does.</p><p>Melissa McCarthy isn’t one to give up easily though and her second performance, ‘Colours of the Wind’ from the Pocahontas soundtrack, was even more spectacular than Jimmy’s rendition of ‘PILLOWTALK’, including stuffed animals, a wind machine and a whole lot of glitter.</p><p>Curious to see what that looked like? You can watch the entire lip sync battle below, and if you’re only here for ‘PILLOWTALK’ (we can’t blame you), just <a href=#>skip to 3:47</a>.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saOHKFWW3tU</p><p>Who do you think should’ve won? And which other Mind of Mine song would you like to see lip synced?
