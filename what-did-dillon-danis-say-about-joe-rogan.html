As the fight unfolded, it became clear that Logan Paul had the upper hand, leaving Danis struggling to make a significant impact. Despite his self-congratulatory tone on social media, many criticized Danis for his lackluster performance and inflated sense of accomplishment.</p><p>Following the fight, Danis’s post-fight comments on social media, including a swipe at Joe Rogan, sparked a backlash. Twitter users quickly debunked his claim, highlighting that Rogan had never compared their fighting skills but merely noted their involvement in influencer fights for monetary gain. The online response to Danis’s post was far from sympathetic, with many questioning his pride in a performance that saw him out-struck 80-9.</p><p>Looking ahead, Danis’s future in the world of mixed martial arts remains uncertain. While he has been praised for his trolling skills, his exaggerated sense of achievement and continued trash-talking may have damaged his reputation and future opportunities. As both fighters move forward, it remains to be seen whether Danis will learn from this experience or continue down the path of controversial self-promotion.
