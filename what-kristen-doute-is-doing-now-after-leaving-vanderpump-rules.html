Yet despite having another project to focus on, she couldn't get TV off her mind, or out of her heart. Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=#>Hollywood Life</a> in September 2020, the reality TV star explained, "[I'm] an entertainer at heart." That's why she was itching to return to the small screen, especially on a show with a similar format to "Vanderpump Rules." "I loved what we did for almost a decade and I would do it again in a heartbeat," she gushed. Doute even admitted to hoping that "Vanderpump Rules" would get canceled because that would free up its cast to work on other projects, preferably with her. "I hope that they get a next season, but in my heart of hearts I [also] don't so that we can all do something together," she confessed.</p><p dir=ltr>In the meantime, Doute continued to promote her book, while also working on her clothing line, <a href=#>James Mae</a>. The Los Angeles-based label, which she co-founded with Magen Mattox, sells graphic T-shirts for men and women, starting at $36, as well as sweatshirts and accessories, like sunglasses and bucket hats.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmbYN4gI6wn5qsXaC%2Fqr%2FTnqVmnJ%2BqwaZ5yKxknaeZo7Ruus6wZJqepJq%2FbrjEmq2ippdiw6K6w56pqa2dpXqzwcueqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
