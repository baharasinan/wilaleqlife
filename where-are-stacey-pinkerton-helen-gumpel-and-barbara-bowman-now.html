The third episode outlines the comic’s ascent through the 1980s while comparing it with the supposed occurrences of rape. Stacey Pinkerton, Helen Gumpel, and Barbara Bowman are only three of the numerous ladies who approached with their accounts throughout recent years. In this way, on the off chance that you’re thinking about what occurred, this is what we know!</p><p>Who Are Stacey Pinkerton, Helen Gumpel, and Barbara Bowman? Stacey Pinkerton was in her twenties and filling in as an airline steward for American Airlines when she initially met Cosby. The hopeful model was wonderfully shocked when he proposed to assist with her vocation. In any case, as per Stacey, Cosby assaulted her in Chicago, Illinois, in 1986. In any case, after the occurrence happened, many recounted to her not to open up to the world about the story, and she yielded. Stacey later said, “I continued to move starting with one location then onto the next, across the Pacific Ocean, later the Atlantic, getting comfortable Europe. No spot was far enough away from Mr. Cosby.”</p><p>In the long run, a few different ladies approaching with their encounters gave Stacey the boldness to open up to the world about her story. Another lady who blamed Cosby for getting rowdy was Helen Gumpel, a model. In 1987, she was included in an episode of ‘The Cosby Show.’ After recording was finished, Helen was approached to visit the set, and she expected it was another tryout. Notwithstanding, Helen was taken to Cosby’s changing area. She guaranteed that he offered her a beverage and remained with his groin in her face.</p><p>Helen said, “I never considered myself a casualty since I rejected his advances. Yet, my vocation was a casualty.” As for Barbara, a hopeful entertainer during the 1980s, the story she shared was like what befell Lili Bernard and Lise-Lotte Lublin. As indicated by Barbara, Cosby welcomed her over to his New York home to discuss her profession and proposition guidance. Then, at that point, a youngster, Barbara, shut down after a glass of wine and awakening just in a shirt and underwear, later acknowledging she was assaulted.</p><p>At that point, Barbara attempted to excuse the occurrence and persuaded herself it was something she had envisioned. In one more episode in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Barbara said that Cosby nailed her down on an inn bed as she attempted to wrestle him off of her. At last, Cosby let her go, indignantly referring to her as “a child.” Barbara discussed how her story was excused, yet that didn’t change the way that she decided to talk about it even a very long time after it happened.</p><p>Where Are Stacey Pinkerton, Helen Gumpel, and Barbara Bowman Now? While Cosby was seen as at real fault for revolting rape, his conviction was toppled in 2021. In the repercussions, Stacey said, “We thought we had a tad of equity, yet that appears to have dispersed right now. Be that as it may, we will continue battling and continue to speak.” Today, she lives in Spain and functions as a radio telecaster. Concerning Helen, a report from 2015 referenced that she lived with her significant other in Connecticut.</p><p>Regardless of Helen’s underlying disillusionment when the conviction was upset, she said, “This is one of the most influential men in the country, on the planet, and a lot of ladies got together – and we didn’t request anything, we simply needed some sort of equity – and we got two years. Also he’s not generally known as ‘America’s Dad.’ That’s very great.” Finally, Barbara is a to a great extent self-trained craftsman who runs her own studio in Scottsdale, Arizona. A report from 2014 expressed she was a hitched mother of two.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYmr%2BmecCrnGarpJawpsWMqaCno5WnwbC6jKGcpZ2eYrS2uc%2Beo2aZnpl6o63Rm5irmV2XvLi5wKdkp6enZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
