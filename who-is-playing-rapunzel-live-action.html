Discovering the Actress Behind It</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Disneyâ€™s animated retellings of traditional fairy tales are so well-known that the name is practically synonymous with them. Disney has adapted several beloved fairy tales to the big screen, including Snow White and Cinderella. Tangled, an animated film produced by Disney in 2010, was an adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale of Rapunzel.</p><p>Rapunzel was voiced by Mandy Moore, and Zachary Levi played her love interest Flynn Rider. After the success of Tangled, rumors surfaced in 2020 that Disney was working on a live-action adaptation of the Rapunzel story. While Disney has traditionally focused on animated adaptations of fairy tales, the studio has recently shifted its focus to live-action adaptations.</p><p>Both Beauty and the Beast and Maleficent have been retold in live-action thus far. These movies demonstrate that the charm of fairy tales can be converted into live-action films, even if they couldnâ€™t quite match the animated masterpieces. The fact that our favorite actresses and performers can play their fairy tale doubles is an added bonus. <strong>Do you know who is playing Rapunzel live action?</strong> Here we will provide you with all information.</p><h2>Who is Playing Rapunzel Live Action?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jada-Pinkett-Smith-as-Rapunzel.webp><p>Disney is cranking out mediocre remakes of their animated classics in live-action. Most recently, we have The Little Mermaid. The Lion King and Pinocchio were the previous two movies we saw. Both are poor adaptations that do the original animated feature no justice. Disney, however, never seems to learn. <strong>Disney has already hired Jada Pinkett Smith as Rapunzel in its live-action adaptation of Tangled.</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Tangled: Jada Pinkett Smith cast in Disneyâ€™s live-action remake. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UmYtEtaVvj</a></p><p>â€” Tate Frazier (@tatefrazier) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 11, 2020</a></p><p>The following is Disneyâ€™s official synopsis of Tangled, in case you need a reminder. When the most wanted and charming bandit in the realm, Flynn Rider, takes refuge in a mystery tower, the last person he expects to discover is Rapunzel, a courageous young woman with an improbable superpower: 70 feet of enchanted golden hair!</p><p>The improbable pair embarks on a thrilling adventure together, complete with comedic and thrilling twists and turns.
