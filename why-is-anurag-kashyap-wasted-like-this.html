In the recent Nawajuddin Siddique movie ‘Haddi’, the talented director has been mesmerised with his villainy we have to say. That led to a belief that his role in Vijay’s Leo would be something bigger and brutal. And audiences who went with such expectations were disappointed today.</p><p>During some recent Bollywood interactions, Anuraga Kashyap spoke highly about Leo and Lokesh Kanagaraj saying that he has done a terrific role in the movie. Going by his statements, it sounded like Anurag shot for a huge number of days for the movie, and has delivered something that stands out. But here in the movie, he’s there only in a single scene, and that too he will be shot dead within some seconds. That disappointed many folks who wanted to see more of the Gangs of Wasseypur director.</p><p>Surely Lokesh Kanagaraj might have shot a lot of sequences with Anurag Kashyap, but that is lost on the editing table. This happens with many popular actors and, unfortunately, even Anurag’s work is also lost that way. Especially in that particular scene when Vijay questions about the drug-route leakage matter, it is understood that the Bollywood director’s work is lost in editing.</p><p class=post-tag>Tags <a href=# rel=tag>Anurag Kashyap</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Lokesh Kanagaraj</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Vijay Leo</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qMHLrZxnm5%2BifK671aKcp52nqHxzgpNpamlnp53GbrXSZpinraKWtG63wKyfspmgYsSiv9Oem2akmaCybsDHoqo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
