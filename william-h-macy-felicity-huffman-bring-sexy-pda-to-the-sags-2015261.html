Macy</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Felicity Huffman</strong></a> have one hot marriage!</p><p>While winning a SAG award and walking the red carpet would be enough for most Hollywood couples, Macy and Huffman had other things on their minds: getting into bed together at the end of the night!</p><p>The handsy couple were as affectionate as ever on the red carpet at the Sunday, Jan. 25 Screen Actors Guild awards, pausing to embrace midway down the carpet, grabbing inanimate butt and sitting arm in arm at the Shrine Auditorium during the ceremony.</p><p>But while the excitement of winning an award can cause many stars to forget their significant other momentarily, Macy took to the stage to collect his gong for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Comedy with his wife firmly in mind.</p><p>Free-styling his speech, Macy insisted he didn't have a script as he wasn't expecting to win. But he didn't leave the stage without a cute (and sexy) shout-out to the woman in his life.</p><p>PHOTOS: Golden Globes Celebrity PDA</p><p>"Flicka, I love going to bed with you," he announced, as he left the stage.</p><p>Later that night, Huffman repaid the compliment with a Twitter message for her husband.</p><p>Love going to bed with you too <a href=#>@WilliamHMacy</a></p><p>— Felicity Huffman (@FelicityHuffman) <a href=#>January 26, 2015</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Love going to bed with you too @WilliamHMacy," she wrote.</p><p>Talking after the show, Macy told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> how his wife's cute nickname came about.</p><p>"It’s disappointing," he said, modestly. "Felicity breaks down to 'Flicka' easily. She’s had the nickname 'Flicka' since she was a kid. And you have to be invited to call her 'Flicka,' and I’m one of those who was invited," he said happily.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaK6ipJyerq55x2akmpupYrOmuMicoK2xXZ3Cp7LMmqVmmqKeu6h50p6vsmWgma5uwM5mq6GdXaiuqL%2BMa2dqbWJrfg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
