Oh wait, how can anyone forgot John Cena vs. Daniel Bryan, back from 2014?</p><p>But today, we’re taking the time machine more deeper into the past. Back in 2002, longtime DX allies Shawn Michaels and Triple H collided at the Biggest party of the Summer. However, before diving straight into their match, let’s take a look at how their rivalry came through.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Nearly two decades ago, when a returning Shawn Michaels was trying to convinve Triple H to join Raw. He obliged, and a big DX reunion was planned. But the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE</a></strong> Universe was shocked when <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Triple H</a> </strong>turned on Shawn Michaels and hit him with the Pedigree. The attacks on Michaels continued, as he was found lying unconscious in the parking lot, just a week later.</p><p>Later, when the footage was reviewed, it was found that it was Triple H, who had orchestrated the entire attack on HBK. This led to one of the most memorable feuds and an Unsanctioned Street Fight was announced, to take place on the night of SummerSlam 2002. The then Raw General Manager <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Eric Bischoff</strong></a> had reasoned that the match was unsanctioned because he felt that the guys would kill each other!</p><p><strong>Related : <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ric Flair’s Net Worth, Real Name, Salary, Wife, House, and more</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wwe-summerslam-2002-triple-h-vs-shawn-michaels-in-an-unsanctioned-street-fight>WWE Summerslam 2002: Triple H vs Shawn Michaels in an Unsanctioned Street Fight</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Adobe_Post_20210808_1823070.5693121217135003-1024x576.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shawn Michaels</a></strong> was returning to in-ring action after 4 years, yet, he managed to deliver one of the best matches of his career, in terms of story-telling. The match had every wrestling style, every weapon, basically there was something in this match for everyone.</p><p>HBK picked up a massive win at Summerslam 2002. But at the same time It also made Triple H look strong as a Heel. He even attacked Michaels after the match with some massive sledgehammer shots. This match even led to Michael’s return to in-ring performances.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it –</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Roman Reigns Net Worth, Real Name, Salary, Wife, House, and more</strong></a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Seth Rollins Net worth, Real Name, Salary, Wife, House, and more</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK571rCcZqulorqmvtKlmKZlop7DorjRsmStqpmluaZ5x2aqoZmno3qutcKhmJ6ko2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
