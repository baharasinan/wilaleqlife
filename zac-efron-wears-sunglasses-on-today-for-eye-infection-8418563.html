"I feel weird being in shades."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I just have a bit of an eye infection,” he continued. “But I really wanted to be here. It’s such a good movie, and I want to come see you guys and tell everyone about it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is not the first time Efron has had to explain a change in his appearance due to a health issue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last year, rampant online speculation that the star got plastic surgery on his jaw — which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Men's Health</a> dubbed "jaw-gate” — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>prompted him to disclose a bit about his medical history</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While speaking with the outlet, Efron acknowledged that his looks had changed in recent years. He explained that this occurred after he fell over at his home and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>broke his jaw</a> in November 2013, making his face and jaw muscles have to work extra hard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While a person's masseter (the muscles used for chewing) and other face muscles should operate "like a symphony,” this was no longer the case after his injury, he told Men's Health.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Zac Efron and his 'Iron Claw' castmates on 'Today' on Wednesday, Dec. 20.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Today Show</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Efron also revealed that he was seeing a physical therapist to help, but he briefly stopped while filming his Netflix series, Down to Earth, in Australia in 2021. And this also caused his jaw muscles to change.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The masseters just grew," he said. "They just got really, really big."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">More recently, Efron underwent a lot of intended physical changes to prepare for his role in The Iron Claw, in which he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dons “tiny spandex” briefs</a> to portray one of the Von Erich brothers — key figures in early '80s pro wrestling — alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jeremy Allen White</a> and Harris Dickinson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elsewhere in his 2022 interview with Men's Health — which was published before his role as the real-life pro wrestler was known — Efron explained that he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>approached bulking up for the part differently</a> than he did for 2017’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Baywatch</a>.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Zac Efron in December 2023.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Leon Bennett/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor said he "fell into a pretty bad depression, for a long time" while recovering from the rigorous training he underwent for the film.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That Baywatch look, I don't know if that's really attainable," he said at the time. "There's just too little water in the skin. Like, it's fake; it looks CGI'd. And that required Lasix, powerful diuretics, to achieve. So I don't need to do that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Efron added, “I much prefer to have an extra, you know, two to three percent body fat.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Iron Claw is in theaters Dec. 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6qWsG6xxaump2Wnmq6zv4ysrKefnJbAtLHSZqanZaSksaLFjJ%2Bmq2WVrrJutc2fnJysmaS7boSTam9ubmM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
